Further to follow,First interview,"","","",20/05/2021,Internet search,United Kingdom,"","","Carrick ISO LUXURY is a technology business that captures an existing luxury market and unlocks a new huge untapped profitable market.  We are the first App and loyalty programme established to retain luxury spend in multiple store locations in the uber-luxury sphere. No other business has before. ISO LUXURY App phase 1 was released in September2019 with the shared brand/ISO objectives of increasing HNW footfall to stores via membership and incentives. ISO members receive in-store and online discounts of 10-25% off our entire range of luxury brands - while based anywhere around the world.  Our members can shop in-store locally, benefit from a VVIP in-store or virtual experience and enjoy money-can’t-buy invitations.  As a lifestyle membership App, we have stores, hotels, services, and top restaurants in one place, opening doors to a world of hidden luxury and benefits.","","","",31/12/2018,"","","","","","","","","","","","","The luxury world is becoming more and more exclusive. Servicing the ultra-VIPs will be harder - meaning it will take more specialised experts, targeted marketing, with real consumer engagement to reach them.  Luxury brands want high spenders to return to their shops, hotels and restaurants, build customer relationships and increase loyalty to enhance sales.  ISO LUXURY has influence and direct access with this uber wealthy consumer.  Elite customers wish to experience brands on a bespoke basis.  Ultra-high spenders like to purchase luxury items or book services that are not available to the general-public. They demand special VVIP in-store experiences, priority tables, enjoy exclusive personal invitations and expect a good deal through benefiting from a discount, loyalty points or rewards. The right personable approach with a generous discount on the purchase or booking creates a personal and memorable experience to which they will want to share with others and return.  ISO Luxury has the opportunity, to reach these uber luxury shoppers. 
Asset Management companies and Private Banks seek collaborations with Luxury Brands that resonate and maximise their relationships with their wealthy clients worldwide.  For example, Reward programmes and events – designed to retain and attract new customers.  ISO LUXURY have already secured the Bank of China and are in advanced negotiations with Coutts and Jordan International Bank.  Our relationships with several other Banks are also strong and we have already hosted successful events with Credit Suisse, Dolfin, Pictet – prior to lockdown.
Through bringing together private banking customers, stores, brands, and luxury consumers, utilising purpose-built technology, maximising brand interaction and unifying brand experiences in the real and virtual world, it opens-up multiple revenue streams for ISO Luxury on all levels.   Registration fees from brands and annual Corporate partner fees from services, up to 12% commission on all brand sales through whatever platform, online, in-store from each of our 200 stores, restaurants and services, shared commission fees with our concierge partners who enable us to source and sell rare products, paid for marketing to our influential database, introduction of paid for membership levels and paid for experiential programme of events, shopping trips and initiatives.","Carrick ISO LUXURY is a Members Club for discerning connoisseurs “In Search Of” the world’s finest brands. We developed an App ‘ISO Luxury’ where members enjoy exclusive discounts upon purchasing online and in-store, unique products and invitations from a growing list of 150 top brand partners and 200 boutiques (brand list, promotions constantly evolves). All represent the true heritage of British and global luxury, see www.isoluxury.com for our existing brand partner list.

First interview,First interview,"","","",11/05/2021,Digicatapult.org.uk,United Kingdom,"","","All coding projects on any code repository platform and CI system can be analysed effortlessly with Meterian.  Once the setup is done, Meterian’s “invisible security” platform automates security and compliance checks of software applications’ open source dependencies with its proprietary technology, enabling exceptionally rapid secure development and approval of committed code.  

For a small initial investment of 1 employee and an annual subscription plan of Meterian, de-risking applications’ open source dependency risks can prevent a cyber/IP breach costing at least 5 to 38 times more than the initial investment cost or over 4% annual revenues as imposed by GDPR penalties.


These risks directly impact consumer trust and the business’ image.  With Meterian enterprises leverage their existing tools and empower their existing workforce to streamline quality control processes and detect anomalies as early as possible in the code production process.  Ship software without vulnerabilities and promote quality deep in your software supply chain. With fewer live errors to correct, more time is made available for your developer to enrich or create new products.",14000.0,237000.0,196 Freston road,31/12/2017,"",Vivian Dufour,Vivian Dufour,Bruno Bossola,"",Vivian Dufour,vivian@meterian.io,'+44(0)7775814145,digital catapult introduction,Ilya Velder,iv@basinghall.partners,B2B,"1. *Security and compliance holes in software apps’ open source supply chain* : We de-risk the organisation’s open source software supply chain, so they never unknowingly release software with a known vulnerability, with outdated parts, or with licences that are not compliant with the business requirements. Our continuous security platform integrates easily so an analysis report is provided in a few to several minutes, removing hours to days of manual effort.

2. *Lack of Time* : Addressing security and compliance issues requires time, which is often sacrificed in favour of speed to market and so the security debt of an application increases. The quickest and best way to address these issues is as and when the app is being developed. Since our solution integrates easily and quickly (with the most complex integration taking a day if the customer has a complex SDLC), enterprises gain immediate visibility and auto-remediation of risks. Our automated solution runs continuously in tandem with the team’s software development workflow, giving teams confidence in change management of code with secured and compliant dependencies.

3. *Lack of consistent quality / compliance control* : Given a code project that uses 60 components, it would take 4.5 weeks of manual effort to research and secure all these components and their sub-components, which can be as deep as several levels. (One of our projects has components 11 levels deep! No human would research the components beyond the second level.) Meterian can automate this effort for _every_ software build within minutes, saving the developer time and leaving him/her free to work on other tasks that require human ingenuity. This is more than 90% gain in efficiency for the organisation per software release. Companies that automate their security and compliance policies benefit from faster remediation times and shorter times to restore service.","As each business evolves through its digital transformation journey, setting up new tools, environments and processes all take time. Investing in the right tools and best practices is a good use of time. As research published in 2020 State-of-DevOps-Report presented by Puppet and CircleCI states, “Security integration is strongly correlated with the ability to quickly remediate critical vulnerabilities. Of those with low integration, 25 percent can remediate vulnerabilities within one day, compared to 45 percent of those with full security integration.” Since Meterian is trusted by enterprises, easy to use by any developer on any source code repository management system, and fits into any DevOps workflow, the software development work force can innovate continuously, freely and securely. 

Meterian’s engineering-driven solution is designed to work seamlessly for one or more than a thousand developers with zero migration costs, maximum coverage and zero false positives.  It replaces 1 FTE developer's time per coding project that uses open source software dependencies for every release. Our AI-powered invisible security platform, lets enterprise secure the application development's software supply chain from Day 1 and for the entire application life cycle. In summary, Meterian impacts the firm’s capability to achieve the highest levels of efficiency to release quality, secure code frequently and consistently, regardless of where they are in their digital transformation journey.

- 65% efficiency with existing team to perform add-on analysis
- 615%+ ROI to avoid a preventable breach",Software; Services; Combined,"Best interoperability.  Our solution is source version control agnostic and can perform software composition analysis regardless of the application’s code repository management system (Git, Mercurial, SVN, CVS, any) without requiring additional staff, kit or long setup times.  At the same time it also seamlessly blends into modern development pipelines, with native integrations with Github, Bitbucket, Azure Devops and all major continuous integration systems.  Once setup is done in minutes to hours, depending on the complexity of your continuous integration process, your open source supply chain will be analysed each time your developers build their code.  All our security products work seamlessly.","Best coverage. Meterian updates its database using more than 20 different sources, including the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), the advisory feeds from GitHub and directly from opensource creators. This allows Meterian to provide better coverage of any of our competitors while reducing dramatically its operating costs, as it uses automation to perform its operations.  Using AI, Meterian incorporates new sources as they become available. Automated aggregation, indexing, and full coverage analysis scales automatically.  We can add new sources in a few weeks.","Best compliance. Meterian automatically produces full compliance reports of all open source components, providing not only a full Bill Of Materials but also collecting the copyright attribution and the full text of all the licences, which can be 50 pages of text and more. This saves an enormous amount of work for any legal/m&a/software IP due diligence department.",Artificial Intelligence (AI); Cyber Security,IT; Software; Service and platfrom,Cost Efficiencies; Disruption,5. 5.

Losses in the cancellation of four major exhibitions in the U.S. and Spain Mobile World Congress, SXSW, E3 and GOOGLE I/O, which were to be visited by 460,000 people, amounted to $1billion.

- multi-language support
- support for the most popular user operating systems: Windows, iOS, Android;
- support for the most popular models of gadgets and computing devices: personal computers, laptops, smartphones, autonomous VR helmets;
- support a large number of users connected and online;
- support for built-in communication tools - chat, audio messages, audio and video calls, video streaming (online broadcast for a large audience);

It is the data which is harvested from all of our online behaviours, dumped into huge databases and then sold at mass to anyone who wants it, all without our permission. Of the 1 trillion ad industry, 3rd party data is about 20% of that, or, 200 billion dollars. That’s a lot.

3rd party data is incredibly poor quality, opaque and fraught with data leaks. However, it is also plentiful, cheap and not regulated.  But all that is about to change.

3rd party data is being finally wiped out as web browsers like Chrome and Safari which fundamentally control it, are turning it off. This is partly in response to increasing consumer concern about their data and also better privacy legislation coming into force globally.

Illuma provides cookieless, machine learning-based audience targeting tools for advertising.

The technology’s primary value proposition is that its method of targeting advertising online drives significantly better ROI for advertisers than competitors. It is also a future-proof method of ad targeting when considering the changing legislative landscape in online advertising eg. Google removing cookies from its ecosystem in January 2022, GDPR in Europe and CCPA in the US.",1100000.0,2500000.0,6-8 Long Lane,31/12/2007,"",Peter Mason,Michael Warren,"","",Peter Mason,peter@weareilluma.com,7983471256,PWC,Ilya Velder,iv@basinghall.partners,B2B,"There are two key problems in online ad targeting that we solve. 

The first is an intrinsic problem to the concept of ad targeting. The second is a more immediate problem brought about by global, industry-wide technical changes in the digital advertising ecosystem.

Problem 1: Combining reach and relevance

Advertisers use online ads for different reasons and with different goals, seeking to elicit different responses from their audience. For example, an ecommerce brand such as Amazon might want users to see an ad and click through to the site to then make purchases, or a charity such as Shelter UK might want users to click through and sign up to donate money. But other brands might advertise without seeking an obvious commercial action; for example, Coca Cola – it does not have products to sell online, but it advertises online. It might want users to simply view a video ad in full.
Yet despite the differing goals, all advertisers have the same fundamental needs for their advertising campaigns: they need their ads to be seen by the right people in the largest numbers possible. In other words, there are two parts to the problem of ad targeting: targeting ads to the right people (relevance), and ensuring that you reach as many of them as possible (reach).
What all advertisers seek is this elusive combination of reach and relevance. Until now, because of the methods used for targeting, that combination has been near-impossible to achieve.
How targeting has been done until now
Until now, targeting technologies fall into two categories: audience (aka behavioural) and contextual.
Audience targeting technologies target people because their past content consumption suggests they are relevant to the brand ad. This approach targets cookies – a technology now under existential threat. Cookies are files stored by websites on people’s computers that can be used to build a picture of their past content consumption (e.g. websites they have viewed, purchases they have made), and assumes that they are relevant for the ad. Audience targeting used to be known as behavioural targeting, but this changed to ‘audience’ on the basis that ‘behavioural’ was too likely to be associated with creepy, privacy-invasive techniques. This approach is viewed in the industry as being good for relevance, but not for reach; since, in essence, it targets individuals, there are inherent limits on its scalability. Outside the industry it is often viewed as an invasion of privacy and its ethics have been questioned. Usually when mainstream press refers to ‘targeted ads’ it is talking about audience targeting.
Contextual targeting technologies target people because the context of the page they are reading is deemed right for the brand’s ad. The approach targets pages using keyword signals. Its premise is ‘travel brand for travel content’ – placing ads against content that matches the topic of the ad. This approach is simplistic and incomplete; it doesn’t account for the fact that, in this example, travel is just one of many things that a person thinking about booking a holiday is interested in. This traditional contextual approach is viewed as good for reach, but not for relevance – it does not allow precision targeting and is based wholly on assumptions made before the campaign starts. It can only target predictable contexts.
However, our work proves that the predictable context performs best only 10% of the time and delivers less than 20% of total engagements and conversions.
For a contextual solution to be as effective as possible, giving both reach and relevance together, it would need to be able to find the unpredictable contexts that can lead to success for an ad campaign. This is what illuma does.
It is accepted wisdom in the advertising industry that there are these two ways to target ads, and that no other solution exists. Currently 80% of online programmatic advertising is based on behavioural analytics. This means that the only alternative is contextual advertising, which has traditionally had a much lower accuracy rate. In reality, illuma offers a significant improvement on both. 

Problem 2: The need for cookieless targeting

Added to this is a more immediate problem for both advertisers and publishers (the organisations who earn revenue by showing ads on their content). In January 2020 Google announced that by 2022 it would end support for third-party cookies in its Chrome browser.
On first read, this may sound like an arcane technical development of little importance to the wider world. In fact, it is not an overstatement to describe the announcement as seismic. 
Its consequences for advertising are enormous. Audience targeting has historically depended entirely on third-party cookies. The technology powering 80% of the ads in a global industry worth over $400 billion (eMarketer, see later figures) is going to disappear from the browser with a 64% share of web traffic worldwide (StatCounter).
The industry has been shaken by this news: brands are worried about how they will continue to target ads effectively; the agencies that they spend billions of dollars with are worried about how they will continue to prove their worth to brands, and publishers are worried about how they will continue to earn advertising revenue if ads no longer work. There has been a scramble in the last year to find cookieless solutions – a category that Illuma falls under.
Some in the industry set about developing alternatives to third-party cookies that would allow advertisers to continue with an audience targeting approach, effectively using different forms of data such as emails, without using third-party cookies. This approach has been generally referred to as using ‘identifiers’ – simply, alternatives to cookies working as a like-for-like replacement.
Then, on 3 March 2021, Google announced that it would not support these alternatives in Chrome either.

 
Many in the advertising industry were hoping that identifiers would be the solution to all their problems – Google’s announcement put an end to the hope. Even mainstream press coverage has been unequivocal about how massive the impact of this change will be on the entire internet.

At the same time, contextual targeting – recently viewed as crude and simplistic – is being touted as an alternative and the answer to some of the advertising industry’s problems. There is a general awareness that advertisers need to invest in contextual solutions that actually work. The difficulty is finding ones that do what they need them to. As we have already seen, traditional contextual is suboptimal – it does not provide the combination of reach and relevance that will convince advertisers to continue parting with billions of dollars.","Illuma solves both problems. We developed our technology specifically to address problem 1 – delivering both reach and relevance, without compromising on either. At the same time, it fulfils the need created by problem 2 – for privacy-friendly cookieless ad targeting technology.

Given the timing of problem 2, which first arose with Google’s initial announcement in 2020 and was cemented as recently as 3 March 2021, illuma is perfectly positioned to capitalise on an extremely pressing market need.

Contextual targeting is the obvious replacement for threatened cookie-based technology, but it misses too much of the opportunity for any ad campaign.",Services,"Competitive advantage.

With the urgent need for cookieless technology, most adtech businesses are now claiming to have a ‘contextual’ solution. Longstanding contextual providers – our competitors – have recently made advances with their technology; Peer39 (one of our closest competitors) has recently launched a ‘marketplace for unconventional contextual targeting data’. After years of traditional contextual targeting, it has conceded that there are myriad factors that can influence the ‘right’ context for an ad, such as weather.

However, this tacit acknowledgement that our approach is the correct one is the closest that any competitor business has come to being able to offer what we do. Another close competitor, Oracle Contextual Intelligence (formerly Grapeshot), provides contextual targeting based on keywords. It is fundamentally the traditional contextual technology that is unable to provide both reach and relevance in the way that Illuma does.","Our technology starts by analysing what’s working in the first day of a campaign, and then targets more content that’s similar.
It does this continually as the campaign runs (campaigns usually run for several weeks or months), constantly scaling out to find more of the right places for an ad – with ‘right’ qualified by live data, not guesswork or assumptions.
It solves the key problem of combining reach and relevance in advertising.
 
In addition to our core Moment Targeting- product, we have continued to invest in research and development, and have released three new products this year, with another coming soon.","Another aspect of our value proposition is being able to target all different types of content simultaneously that drive campaign success. illuma uniquely reacts to all every different page that is delivering against a campaign KPI (eg. video completion or click) each day, by pushing through more of those types of pages to target. 
The content that drives the most engagement is chosen by illuma’s technology and pushed into a segment for continued targeting each day. As the content changes, thus effecting campaign KPIs our AI intelligently reacts by refreshing the appropriate segments accordingly. This ensures that we are fluidly adjusting to consumers behavioural patterns during the campaign and intelligently scaling segments with only relevant content. We use zero identifiers, and our campaign-reactive AI approach is unique for the industry",Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence (AI),Software; Media; Automotive,New Market; Disruption,5. 5.

Experience working in agencies coupled with first hand experience in trading ad-space means the product and solution has been created to solve problems for the target market in which they have operated.","The management team do not have first hand experience operating in larger fund raising environments.

Hence we have sought external advisors to cover the gaps in the internal knoweldge.","COO: being hired as soon as possible (Business Operations are currently the biggest time drain for the CEO) to take on the day-to-day organisational management of the business - specific focus on the following: 

a) Liaison between HR (Chief People), Sales and Finance to make sure there is a super-clear and effective package for success remuneration 

b) Solid understanding of contracts and retainers with media and tech companies to move us – where possible – towards contractual recurring-revenue relationships with our partners. 

CTO: this is less urgent than the COO (tech demands less of the CEO’s time) but is a very important hire:

a) Currently we have exceptionally talented PhD data scientists in the business but lack a heavyweight, good communicator in sophisticated tech conversations that we are increasingly engaged in. 

b) We also need to be looking at streamlining the infrastructure to maximise margin and make the business as attractive as possible for exit. 

The CMO and CPO (Chief People Officer) are planned on a contract basis for the initial 9-12 months. Priority being the CPO as they’re required to support with the time-consuming hiring process for the COO and CTO.  
Furthermore, the CPO role is required to facilitate the personnel growth across all departments and help maintain the culture of the business as we grow, focused on training and staff retention which is vital in tech. 

The CMO role is key for us to create and organise the branding and marketing functions but is less urgent in the C-Suite ordering.","Whilst not essential a perfect investor would come with significant connections in DSPs, media agencies or brands, to speed up growth and explore exits. 

It would be preferred that there would be the potential to have follow-on Series B, if needed, and support the management in approaching strategic opportunities in the market as they arise.

The contextual ad market is going to move faster than before in the next 12 months and we appreciate that unique technology may become available that can be acquired and integrated into illuma.

Passengers are using their free time while commuting to shop online, in the UK alone 20% of all online shopping occurs during the morning commute and while mobility companies are allowing people to have free time, they are not monetizing that and miss on a huge opportunity to take a share of the eCommerce opportunity.","For mobility apps seeking to increase revenues, retention and loyalty, Enroute offers its commerce and loyalty SDK that allows passengers to ride for FREE as they shop, interact and collect items from locations next to their destination – different from the competition because we provide our software to mobility companies as an SDK and not as a B2C app, because we have a superior recommendation engine and provide a unique location based service that allows for click and collect and curbside deliveries.

This is possible through a tailored shopping platform that is integrated into mass transit applications and ride hailing apps. Customers receive a personalised shopping feed of a network of hundreds of retailers, among them ASOS, Amazon, ebay and many more. With every purchase, Enroute receives a commission that is forwarded to the mobility partners who, in turn, forward it to their customers in the form of credits for the current or future rides. Consequently, this allows mobility services to reduce the effective costs for their customers without having to cut back on profit margins, as well as to offer a more interesting and enjoyable service, resulting in higher customer experience and thus customer loyalty.","Retailers profit from new and above-average conversion rates, given Enroute's smart prediction system that tailors product placement according to individual profiles.

The system integrates into your client communication channels and automatically analyses billions of datapoints in real-time. We pride ourselves on removing the need for any manual inputs which generates unparalleled time savings compares to traditional systems, as well as a far superior dataset that enterprises can use to drive decisions.
Enterprise client relationships are increasingly complex and have far outgrown the technology used to service them. The shift to digital relationships means an increase in touch points, less cohesion and less visibility. Most importantly, 9 out of 10 clients leave without complaining and it costs 5-7x more to get new clients than to keep them, making the need to capture these data all the more important.
Every other industry has already embraced intelligent solutions to understand their client data. We use Spotify to tell us what to listen to, Netflix what to watch and Amazon what to buy. Yet enterprise relationships are still being serviced by frameworks designed in the 1990s, such as CRMs.
These systems of record cannot progress to systems of intelligence. Up to 30% of people’s time is spent populating these manual systems. The data are always subjective, always incomplete and soon obsolete.

-	Products and manufacturing processes are ever increasing their complexity, which makes their mastery by human workers a time consuming process that undermines the fast-paced requirements of advanced manufacturing technologies. In addition, the high complexity makes it difficult to leverage automation and a human worker is prone to making mistakes. 
-	There is a shortage of highly skilled workers with the required competences has lead to a drop in productivity and quality. In fact, studies show that the skill crisis will cost as much as $11.5 trillion USD and that the cost of poor quality can correspond to 5-40% of the sales. 
-	Manufacturing companies have adopted the industry 4.0 paradigm with the digitalisation of their operations, benefiting from the richness and wealth of data collated from the use of sensors. However, companies remain in the dark concerning what takes place with the workers in the workplace.","With KIT-AR, a manufacturing company has the solution for digitalisation of the workers across the shopfloor with the following benefits: 1- the workers increase their productivity by reducing the amount of non-value time and immediate access to knowledge at point of need; 2- increased quality via automated quality assurance that assess the correct task completion and state, leading to less amount of rework and minimise waste; 3-A knowledge based approach for creating instruction sets that allow reduction of setup times and mitigation of upskilling of the workforce;  4- quality traceability by capturing the rich context of key stages of the process for subsequent analysis; 5- business value insights into what takes place on the shopfloor by rich contextual information",Services; Software,"KIT-AR uses a model based approach to creating the instruction sets, which goes beyond the current “powerpoint” approach of content creation. This means that at each step of the process, our solution knows the input, operations to be carried out, what tools to use and the output. Based on the model, more complex instructions sets are possible to support that otherwise manually created would not be feasible.","KIT-AR leverages the context rich of the instruction sets to support quality assurance in the form of checkpoints in the process, each addressing a particular problem (eg: detection of screws, correct application of the sealant, correct assembly of a part in relation to another)","KIT-AR uses process mining and analytics to provide business value insights into the data collated form the use of the solution by the workers.

First interview,"",Hydrogen / Fuel cell; Energy,Duisport; Brose,"",21/03/2021,"",United Kingdom,"","","We are pioneering a low-cost, cobalt and lithium free, solid-state sodium battery that is suited to address both larger-scale EV transport and energy storage markets. Our battery has significant advantages in terms of safety, thermal management (crucially it operates agnostic to ambient temperature) and supply chain (uses abundant materials). We believe our battery will greatly help accelerate global efforts towards net zero and can save ~4.5bn tonnes of CO2 per annum by 2050. 

The LiNa battery is an innovative re-engineering of the operationally proven sodium-metal-chloride chemistry that was originally developed in the 80s and 90s, however major design limitations and the emergence of lithium-ion batteries has meant that there have been no major breakthroughs or performance advancements in the chemistry since. 

Using a materials engineering skillset acquired over decades in fuel-cell sector, we have been able to make breakthrough developments and are already generating data on a par with incumbent lithium-ion.",0.0,0.0,Unit 8 Sharpes Mill White Cross Business Park,31/12/2016,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/cmonget/93025915035150/4921198370427366213/Logo.png,Gene Lewis,James Morrish,Richard Dawson,"",John Wilson,jwilson@lina.energy,7812382633,Basinghall Partner,Ginette Oebel,go@basinghall.partners,B2B,See answer to 2.4,"Below is set out our thoughts on price, raw material availability, ethics  and technical challenges for lithium ion batteries below which our technology overcomes. 

Ethics
•	Aside from the economic arguments which are very strong, the key raw materials in a lithium-ion battery (cobalt and lithium) have serious ethical challenges.
•	In the case of cobalt over 60% of global supply comes from the DRC where there is the issue of slave/child labour
•	In the case of lithium, the mining process to extract lithium is extremely damaging to surrounding ecosystems and uses unsustainable amounts of water.

Price
•	Lithium-ion price reductions have been driven largely by scaling-up manufacturing as demand has increased.
•	There are a wide range of views in the market but the system cost of a lithium-ion battery is c$140/kWh currently – the widely held view is that this will need to reduce to below $100/kWh for EVs to be economically viable for mass market adoption.
•	Any further reductions in lithium-ion costs will be limited by raw material prices which now make up a very large proportion of the battery cost.
•	At scale manufacturing LiNa’s battery system will cost c$75/kWh, almost 50% less than lithium-ion. The difference is driven by raw materials – our battery’s key raw materials will be salt and iron which are both abundantly available and therefore cheap.

Raw Materials
•	Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (reputable raw materials analysts) are forecasting that there will supply shortages of the key raw materials in a lithium ion battery (cobalt, lithium, nickel) by the middle of this decade as lithium-ion gigafactories are built out and demand outstrips supply of raw materials
•	It takes 6-8 years to bring new raw material supply on line and the miners are not investing in these raw materials today as market prices do not support further investment.
•	The market is beginning to recognise this – battery grade lithium carbonate prices are up 68% in the last 2 months alone. 
•	It is also work noting that China has secured the bulk of global lithium and cobalt supply and therefore this is likely to be a major constraint on any lithium ion manufacturing in N.America and Europe by 2025.

Applications
•	Lithium ion is not well suited to applications where large-scale is required (commercial vehicles, energy storage in warm climates) as it has a very narrow temperature operating range and therefore the cooling systems make it unviable economically.
•	LiNa’s battery has a much wider operating temperature range and is therefore ideally suited to applications such as commercial transport (lorries, buses, shipping, trains etc) as well as grid storage alongside renewable energy in hot/cold climates where lithium ion is not suitable.",Hardware,Clever re-engineering of an operationally proven chemistry using decades of modern materials engineering knowhow,Clean supply chain that uses abundant materials results in low cost,"Safe, simple thermal management - operates in its own microclimate therefore agnostic to ambient temperature",New batteries,Automotive; Gas; Utilities; Energy; Oil,New Market; Disruption,2. 2.

Complying with PSD2, GDPR, 5 AML, and other specific regulations. To comply with all these regulations Banks and other Financial Services have started to add stringent controls around their Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and onboarding process, leading to a sharp rise in the onboarding cost. These measures negatively affect the customer acquisition process, resulting in unwanted delays and lengthy time-to-cash cycles.

- more sales and payments through digital sales (online and mobile) and with lower transaction costs;

- higher flexibility to adapt to demand variation and peak/off-peak times through smart and dynamic pricing.

Benefits for riders:
- easier and more powerful trip planning, combining more mobility options and several criteria (faster, cheaper, ecological, etc.);
- pay all legs, even if multimodal, through just one payment;
- combined information, guidance and notifications in real-time to do and control the trip (e.g. expected time of arrival);

- Problem: global coordination and synchronization of machines performing a task jointly. This requires a global clock and transmission mechanism that guarantee reception and execution of the commands at a given time for all machines. In scenarios with tens or hundreds of connected machines, commercial wireless technologies cannot provide reliable communications nor timed delivery of data. Our solution addresses the global synchronization problem and scales with the number of devices in the network. Our solution allows multiple machines to send and receive inputs and execute their tasks at the same instant. We are not aware of any commercial solution solving this problem.

- Problem: for massive swarm of robots there is a need to allocate resources in a scalable and efficient way so that each robot can receive a minimum amount of data to perform a task. Commercial wireless technologies do not scale with the number of devices. Our solution can allocate hundreds of devices, guaranteeing the transmission of (analog and digital) data for industrial robotic/automation applications.

- Problem: the data flow in the PLC domain has tight temporal requirements to correctly conduct operations over machines, sensors and actuators. Commercial wireless technologies were designed to operate in tens or hundreds of times larger temporal scales, thus, they are not suitable for real-time industrial networking. Our solution can smoothly integrate into the industrial PLC networks because it operates with the same temporal requirements and communication protocols.

For the IT perspective

- Problem: mobile machines and robots require a dedicated reliable wireless connection that supports continuous and constant high TCP/IP data rates. Commercial wireless solutions are not designed to provide dedicated and continuous connections. Our wireless solution handles TCP/IP traffic transparently optimizing the radio spectrum resources for the specified data rate.","'- Enable flexibility in the production line with significant cost reduction in changeovers;

These applications can be classified as non real-time, for example, connecting sensors that transmit low data volumes in periods of minutes or hours.

1) Employees, who nowadays have the possibility to work remotely, don't want to pay with their own money for flexible workspaces (ex. Coworking, Day-use Hotels or Cafès). Working at home is not a long term solution, especially for the Millenial generation. Traditional office-work will become less attractive, due to the well known problems like commuting and hard work-life balance.

2) Companies with no remote working policies will be less attractive in the future. They have to adapt to the new trend. They must improve the efficiency of their spaces and adapt to the new design of the offices of the future, which will be more distributed, smaller, modular and human centered.

3)Workspace providers like Coworking, but also Hotel and Cafes base their business mostly on freelancer's customer segment and it's not enough to generate big revenues (see the WeWork crisis). On top of this, especially after 2020, flexible workspace market is crowding and there is no marketplace that allows the worker to compare all their different offers and conditions.","We want to let employees work into flexible workspaces. This means:

Employees can enjoy their remote work thanks to the ""Hopp"" benefit prepaid card. They can have bonus cash provided by the company that can be spent in all the Hopp-certified workspace partners visible on the Hopp search platform. They can set their preferences according to their needs, and Hopp will display the best tailored solution among our Coworking, Hotel and Cafè partner workspaces.

Companies can reduce their space and make it more efficient. They can attract the best workers with remote-work oriented corporate policies and innovative contractual forms. 

Workspace providers significantly expand their customer segment, opening them up to employees. Their revenues would be enormously higher. Once they become our partners, they will be visible on our search platform and can accept all payments made with the Hopp Card.",Combined,"We are the platform that offers a true B2B solution for companies that want to switch to work remotely. Our system is flexible and everyone benefits from us: Companies, Workspace providers and Employees. The result is a distributed ecosystem of offices, less commuting, more social connection. We make holiday working possible, the growing work trend.","We guarantee that our workspace partners are actually suitable for work. Companies have the certainty that their employees can work in the best possible conditions, wherever they want.","No more loneliness for those who do not work in the office. Thanks to the Hopp Platform, workers not only find their perfect workspace, but can socialize with other members of the Hopp community (""Hoppers"").

The system then automatically returns to its launch point for re-arming and re-use. Its initial concept of operation is aimed at a soldier in a hostile environment with a threat vector from small drones but of course it has applicability for base, infrastructure and VVIP protection, amongst other uses. There a number of subsequent iterations of the system that can tailor for other Use Cases and the software itself is certainly of interest for other manufacturers to incorporate into their own counter drone systems.

However, the bearings in the high-speed machines are causing about 70% of all failures, OEMs are not having the high-speed bearings expertise in-house and the solutions available on the market are not flexible and extremely expensive.","1. Higher energy efficiency to allow less than 2 year payback time.
2. Virtually no maintenance costs to reduce overall equipment costs by 80%.
3. Oil-free operation to open new markets for SpinDrive customers.

It allows to cut at least 50% of the purchase price when compared with the other Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB) players due to usage of the integrated power modules. It ensures necessary redundancy and simultaneously low costs. Modules can be replaced fast ensuring minimum downtime. This is a patent-pending feature. Simultaneously our controller hardware can cover the whole operational range of our target customers from 50 kW up to 2 MW motors. If we need to go beyond 2 MW, SpinDrive has a patent-pending technology, which allows two or more of our standard controllers to work in parallel to serve bigger machines.","SpinDrive has the most advanced control algorithms using digital twin approach. We are running the plant model on our controller, which adjust the control algorithms on the go and adapts to the changes in the OEM unit during the operation. It ensures reliable operation and is a patent-pending technology. Also this feature allows plug&play controller installation and commissioning. So our engineers don’t need to go to the field around the globe and the commissioning can be done remotely, which reduces the overall costs.","SpinDrive provides flexible cooperation model for our customers, which is not available on the market. We are able to outsource actuators and sensors manufacturing to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) according to our design. This can minimize overall package costs of OEM and it’s an attractive option for some OEMs who have established supply chain for similar kind of hardware components.

When faults occur without time domain and interconnected presentation of data means that a huge cost of repair is spent on send the wrong people to the wrong problem. This is solved by presenting and share the correct visuals with the correct people.  Finally the ability to learn the building physics (capability of space and assets) means we can employ prediction and allow building owners to take advantage of their operational flexibility.,"Benefits

realized that they have to become faster,
more flexible and more efficient if they
want to survive competition against
large corporations or threats like Corona. More and more SMBs want to handle
this challenge with SaaS software, e.g.
a website builder to set up their shop,
HR Software or a CRM system. Thereby
they tap into new problems like: “What is
the right Website builder for my needs?”,
“What other SaaS services should I
use to improve my daily performance?“
SMBs need 10 to 15 SaaS products per
employee, which means at least 10 to
15 monthly bills and hundreds of logins
with no overlapping centralized user management system. Employees are also
excellent targets for Hackers, because
they usually have only limited knowledge
about passwords, phishing and security.","VIPFY is the one platform to manage
and use all SaaS-Tools. Every employee
will have direct access (Single SignOn) to his assigned services from the
dashboard of his VIPFY App. Admins
can manage licence assignments for all
employees through a central manager.
VIPFY will provide the admin with Usage Statistics. He sees which licenses
are not in use and has the opportunity to
cancel unused services to save money.
In the marketplace, the company can
purchase SaaS services. The suggestion algorithm will help the SMB to find
the best Service on a very individualized
level by using their profession and company size. VIPFY will centralize all invoices and charge the SMBs just once a
month. Already used accounts can also
be integrated into the VIPFY platform.
To enhance security an AI-algorithm verifies every user continuously based on
its behaviour and ensures security even
if the attacker has full possession of all
valid hardware.",Software; Services,"U.S. organizations wasted $30 billion on unused software per year.

3 out of 4 companies have already been victims of Cybercrime. In Germany alone, damage amounting to 102 billion euros was causedWho are the perpetrators? 33% of this damage is caused by former employees.

Single Sign-On increases employee productivity and saves costs for the employer. An average employee needs about 20 seconds per login. With ten applications per day, this amounts to 200 seconds per day and 12.5 hours per year. With a median salary of an office worker, this equals $300 per year per employee.

VIPFY is your solution for these problems

Today's B2B drones are very rigid, and it is almost impossible to exchange any sensors, or to implement software upgrades. That results to companies and universities purchasing new drones every time they want to perform a new application, or they want to use a new type of sensor or software tool.

First, as the regulations in the financial sector are becoming more and more tough and complex, banks are forced to change their processes in a very short period of time, which represents a huge challenge for them.
 
Second, these changes also imply huge costs for the banks. Most of them spend about 80% of their IT budget on legacy systems run on-premises, making operations difficult to control, less secure and less flexible.
 
To address these issues, we strongly believe that implementing new innovative solutions is the fastest and most efficient option for these institutions.
 
By 2022, every investment and financial institution will have to comply with the new Financial Review of the Trading Book regulation (FRTB).
 
In order to facilitate such implementation, we’ve launched Prism which combines automated financial risk calculations, advanced data encryption technology and smart cloud distribution.
 
With this innovative and perfectly suited solution, banks will be able to quickly and smoothly adapt their processes, while significantly reducing their costs.","Adapt their operations in a less costly way than a reengineering and automate the operations in the risk management processes that involve the hiring of specialized personnel and working hours in the process.

Our research shows that consumers are demotivated because it is hard to track points from multiple programmes and the redemption value is low. It takes too long to earn a meaningful reward with most of the programmes.
•	Only 23% are satisfied with ways the rewards are redeemable. 
•	57% of members don’t know their points balance. 
•	54% of programme members are inactive. 

As a result, $360 billion worth of reward points remain unredeemed across the globe ($100bn points in the US and £6bn in UK remain unspent).
Businesses end up spending time and money on loyalty programmes that fail to drive loyalty and reward customers.

First time in the history for loyalty marketing – introducing a global reward point exchange solution that does not reduce the value of reward points when consumers exchange & consolidate points and this is done in real-time. 

The current solutions of reward points exchange are expensive for the consumers. As much as 40-80% of the value of reward points is lost during the exchange.

5.	Donate loyalty points to one of the thousands of registered charities on the LoyalT network.

The unified listing portal is a window to access everything that is listed online. A known fact identified by the real estate stakeholders is that what is listed online has problems of data quality and consistency.

Alfredo’s unified listing portal uses multiple machine learning techniques to identify problems and correct them regarding data consistency and quality. The most notorious examples of these algorithms are:

Natural language processing (NLP) is used to identify whether the asset maps’ position is in concordance with what's posted on writing. Internally we verified that 12% of all assets listed online have their map position wrongly inserted to confuse competitors;

Image recognition is used to identify if the same real estate asset is listed on multiple platforms. Although there are multiple solutions for this problem, the team developed a novel approach using deep learning, graph theory and semi supervised learning to achieve the best results. Given that the same asset might have different representations on multiple platforms, our approach consolidates what the real representation of the asset is. We found out that 50%+ of the online listing are duplicates, and our methodology correctly identifies them as such.","'- Personalized lead generation funnel

Deal call candidate,"",Data; Retail; HoReCa; ecommerce; Privacy,"","",09/11/2020,Indico Capital,Portugal,"","","Modatta is a marketplace for consented personal data empowered solutions, that will allow companies to pay users directly for their data or for profile targeted interactions to tackle their needs on awareness, lead generation, sales, loyalty, big data and analytics. Interactions can take several forms like showing a text or video, directing to an url, answering direct questions, testing Apps, subscribing to services, or any other suitable for a mobile device. We aim to provide our users with an additional revenue stream, while giving companies an alternative to reach their audience that is fully compliant with privacy regulations like GDPR. 
The way companies reach potential customers today is intrusive and rely heavily on cold approaching their target group. This leads to unnecessary costs and creates a feeling of discomfort on end users, that often feel their privacy invaded by the same companies that are trying to cause a good impression. 
Modatta aims to bring individuals control over their personal data. More than that, we want to empower them to monetize their data, while maintaining full control on how, where and why their data is used and by which companies. 
Personal data management represents a major risk for companies, so providing them with explicitly and freely consented data would almost eliminate the risk of non-compliancy. By relying on profiles created and kept by their owners, we can increase accuracy and reduce the customer cost of acquisition. 
By fine targeting end users, and giving them a choice on the type of interaction with interested companies, we are enabling companies (brands) and potential customers to create a positive relationship, based on respect and mutual benefit. 
Modatta is available as a mobile app for individuals, and a web portal or DB API for companies. We are considering using blockchain for smart contract enforcement and register auditable transaction logs, without ever compromising the security and confidentiality of the user’s data. 
All money circulating in the platform will be fiat, so that companies can easily join (and use their typical payment methods to subscribe the service), and users can receive in their local currency, making adoption easy and familiar.",0.0,78804.0,Rua dos Bombeiros Voluntários 129 Escritório 1,31/12/2018,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/cmonget/93025915035150/4807553903819852279/Modatta_Logotipo_Positivo.pdf,Eduardo Pinto Basto,Eduardo Pinto Basto,Rodrigo Moretti,"",Eduardo Basto,eduardo@modatta.org,'+351966655741,Basinghall Partner,Ilya Velder,iv@basinghall.partners,B2B2C,"Personal data management represents a major risk for companies, so providing them with explicitly and freely consented data would almost eliminate the risk of non-compliancy.

For companies we are providing a brand new way of reaching their potential customers, fully aligned and compliant with data protection policies like GDPR. We enable companies to access consented personal data directly from potential or current customers, or engage with specific targeted audience to meet their need on analytics, awareness, lead generation, customer acquisition and loyalty.
For external data (Analytics, Surveys, Market research, etc..), companies rely today on data brokers, that pass the responsibility of compliance of that data to the company. As data is gathered without the knowledge (and most of the times consent) from their owner, it is very difficult to ensure information is up-to-date, reliable and compliant.
For 1-to-1 marketing, companies rely on big tech firms (like google and facebook) that live from auto generated profiles, trying to guess who we are and what we want. This leads to incredible inefficiencies, proof being the very low hit rate on individual ads.
Modatta solve both problems, by working on a consent based model, that ensure the user benefits, and is always aware what their data is being used for. Moreover, the user is the one who creates and maintains their profile (and Modatta validates to make sure it is accurate), so there is a much higher accuracy on targeting, reducing the inefficiency and overall campaign cost.",Services,"We receive and pay in cash.

As sphere is able to cover all major enterprise use cases companies do not need to purchase and integrate several MR tools but can stay within a single application with a well-designed and consistent user interface. Future functions and extensions will be released within the very same software platform, making the solution even more powerful.",Software,"Most companies use a wide range of software tools to keep their operations running, resulting in a fragmented software landscape. Thereby, individual applications are often not well integrated. sphere, on the other hand, is not going to be yet another software tool to be managed and maintained in an isolated manner.
sphere will offer standardized, out-of-the-box integrations for the most popular ERP and CRM software (SAP, Oracle, Salesforce etc.), therefore providing a seamless integration of sphere into a company’s software landscape. This allows companies to use their already existing content, such as documents, 3D models, workflows etc. and user structure immediately within sphere.","sphere supports a range of different MR devices from several manufacturers (e.g. Magic Leap, Microsoft, Lenovo, nReal), which gives enterprises the freedom to choose hardware based on their unique requirements. This is vital, as each device comes with its own individual strengths and weaknesses and one device being perfect for one company might not be the right fit for another. Consequently, dependency on a single hardware vendor is prevented, eliminating the risk of a lock-in. Besides MR glasses, sphere also supports tablets and smartphones (with a limited feature set), allowing companies to use their existing hardware as well.
holo|one ensures to always support the latest and best-suited hardware, which is also reflected in the architecture of the software. It is fundamentally built with cross-platform in mind, which means that it has a self-contained core system. New hardware with different specifications or input systems (gesture recognition or remote controls) are supported efficiently by modularly extending the solution and connecting the platform specific parts to the core system.","A key part of sphere is the integrated Asset Pipeline which allows to bring arbitrary content into Mixed Reality. This includes images, audio files, videos, documents and even 3D/CAD models. The import of existing 3D content into MR still provides a large challenge for users and companies. CAD models are created on high-end desktop workstations and are far too complex to be directly used on MR devices. Most people still manually optimize their model which, depending on the model complexity, can take several days. sphere eliminates this expensive and cumbersome process. The Asset Pipeline allows users to upload their CAD files to sphere and they are converted and optimized to MR-compatible 3D models within minutes.",Augmented Reality (AR),Automotive; IT; Construction,Cost Efficiencies; Disruption; New Market,5. 5.

For private operators, (e.g. 
Spas, Resorts & Health Clubs)
“Providing a virtual aqua fitness service is financially much less risky than hiring a real aqua fitness instructor. As a spa manager, I can increase the number of weekly activities provided for our members while cutting personnel expenses. Furthermore, Hydrohex screens are very easy way to bring in inspiring and updating activities for our members. As a result, they spend more time in our premises and spend more money to the services and goods we sell.”

For public operators:

“Hydrohex is a hazzle-free way to provide activities and service for everybody regardless of the gender, age or skill level. Furthermore, especially in overcrowded sites, it is a good way to tempt some customers to visit the pool during off-peak hours which has been challenging before Hydrohex due to the lack of off-peak hour activities.

Installed on the top floor of the building, I-Pro 1 system’s inertial actuator and its motion sensors minimize the structure’s oscillations  during an earthquake. Moreover, the patented technology allows to autonomously identify the structure, avoiding the need of further engineering. Moreover, the I-Pro 1 system offers a continuous building’s structural monitoring and a post-earthquake analysis. 
I-Pro 1 is one-size-fits-all product, it is standard in weight and dimension. Depending on the building characteristics and the seismic improvement required, it is sufficient to install a greater or lesser number of devices to obtain the result desired. The innovative approach allows to offer a tailor-made solution with all the benefits of a scalable product, offered in a market characterized by non-standardizable offerings.
ISAAC aims to disrupt the building renovation and civil engineering market by adopting a technology and customer-driven approach; I-Pro 1 is the best solution in versatility, non-invasiveness and reduction in installing time.",0.0,190236.0,Via Filippo Argelati 2,31/12/2016,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/cmonget/93025915035150/4699406090011580177/ISAAC_Brand_V_colori.jpg,Alberto Bussini,Anna Impedovo,Alessandro Torti,Nicole Mazzone,Alberto Bussini,alberto.bussini@isaacsrl.com,'+39 0280889541,Gabriele Rampinelli,Ilya Velder,iv@basinghall.partners,B2B,"During a seismic event, the real issue is not the earthquake itself, but how buildings behave in response to such a phenomenon. In the seismic-prone regions of Europe, the majority of buildings was designed without provisions for earthquake resistance or with moderate-level seismic codes. For example, in Italy alone, there are 5.5 million buildings declared at risk.
If not designed and constructed properly, civil structures can experience damages or even collapses during seismic events. This challenging problem is usually approached by directly designing and constructing the new building properly. When comes to the already existing buildings, many solutions exist; however, they all share a common weak point: they always have to be studied ad hoc and tailored for the specific analysed building. Moreover, residents are usually required to evict the building, creating serious problems for residential buildings and economic losses for businesses and offices. This increases costs, installation invasiveness and time for the seismic protection of structures. Due to all these issues, people usually lose interest in pursuing the seismic retrofit of their buildings.
Thanks to an industrial approach ISAAC solves all these issues offering a standard product, that protects and monitors building’s structure 24 hours per day. According to the building type and seismic improvement required, a different number of devices is installed reducing  invasiveness and installation time, avoiding the eviction of  the inhabitants.","ISAAC introduces several innovations not available in the current competitive landscape. The I-Pro 1 system innovation is disrupting the current ways of providing seismic protection, responding to clear market need, pain points and perfect market timing. Indeed, ISAAC solution is completely non-invasive, thanks to the external installation, avoiding people from leaving their home for months during the installation. Moreover, the modularity of the system allows to adapt the solution to many different buildings type, without spending time for an ad hoc intervention.",Combined,"Non-invasiveness: The current solutions for the seismic retrofit of existing buildings have to be studied ad hoc, tailored for each building analysed and require the eviction of the tenants. The I-Pro 1 system innovative approach allows the central sensors and device controller to perform continuous monitoring of the building, assessing the state of the structure in real-time and not requiring the eviction of the inhabitants. Moreover, thanks to the autonomous identification of the building parameters, the mathematical model of the structure is continuously updated. Thus, possible damages propagating in the construction can be detected, making the maintenance operations faster and targeted. This minimizes the risks of possible damages or collapses of the structure, guaranteeing both the comfort and safety of tenants.","Shortening installation time: To start protecting the building from seismic events the only installation is needed. It is sufficient to place I-Pro 1 technology on the building’s top floor to protect and monitor the structure.
 I-Pro 1 is simple to install in single or multiple configuration, in fact it is a plug and play technology; this means that the need of engineering studies is greatly reduced","Versatility: It is possible to enjoy maximum flexibility thanks to I-Pro 1.  I-Pro 1 is standard in size and weight, depending on the building characteristic and the seismic improvement required, it is sufficient to install a greater or lesser number of devices to obtain the result desired. Indeed I-Pro1 system is suitable for different building types, ad hoc studies are not required, the only variable is the number of devices to be installed. The system automatically tunes the control systems and algorithms according to the structure characteristics and the earthquake intensity. This innovative approach allows to offer a tailor-made solution with all benefits of an industrial product. As well as for seismic protection, I-Pro 1 can be used to monitor structures during post-earthquake analysis; in fact, I-Pro 1 is capable of monitoring the structure 24 hours a day, detecting developing damages.",Artificial Intelligence (AI); IOT; Sensors; Big Data,Cities and urban development; Property and facility management; Construction; Real Estate,Disruption,4. 4.

Indeed, the customer asks for a rough estimate for the whole seismic intervention following the first preliminary analysis. However, for ISAAC it is complex to define a quite precise price since the effective cost of the intervention will be clearly defined after the design phase. Once ISAAC will have gained more experience, it will certainly be easier to define, already during the preliminary analysis phase, an estimated price which is closer to what will then be the official quote delivered to the customer following the signature of the project.","Italian government introduced a tax incentive, named Sisma Bonus, which allows a 110% reimbursement on the total cost of seismic retrofit intervention.  ISAAC would like to take advantage of this incentive which will last until 2021.

2. Secondly, they are increasingly squeezed by platforms such as Amazon to do more and pay more for campaigns. Margins are tight, and a change in the cost of advertising by just a few percentage points can mean the difference between profit and loss.

We deliver automated GCHQ accredited Cybersecurity Awareness Programmes that are tailored, targeted, engaging and effective at reducing risk related to human error and behaviours, evidenced as an example by our risk reduction of 75% for phishing within HMRC and wider government departments. We have a client retention rate of over 86% due to both the effectiveness of our solutions and the ability to evidence this with qualitative & quantitative metrics. 
Bob’s Business takes compliance and cyber training, simplifies it, pumps it with emotion and engaging experiences that evoke responses that ensure people have empathy and understand cyber security. We analyse risk, based on knowledge and perceptions, and automate the delivery of engaging campaigns that influence behaviours and create secure cultures.

The current market does not aim to change people’s behaviours whereas we build upon research about how people work and learn best by being sensitive to their emotional responses. 

The recent effect of COVID-19 has seen  increases in cyber attacks as reported by the BBC based on NCSC data, particularly targeting staff/users. As businesses use the lessons learnt from home working and a shift towards flexible working for the long term, security training will need to focus on users as well as technological solutions. Current solutions in the market still have a very technical and jargon approach to training, whereas our client feedback has evidenced the need for simplified messaging aimed at the average end user.

Our automated E-commerce solutions provide value for money entry for micro and small businesses to acquire cybersecurity training at cost effective pricing with a SaaS model.","The Bob’s Business approach also advocates the empowerment of the individual with training and phishing exercises being regarded as a positive action backed by the organisation. This differs from our competitors as we understand that it is important for security and phishing campaigns to be viewed by employees as a positive exercise. 

Benefits:

Training compliant with regulatory and legal requirements, underpinned by accreditation with GCHQ and other industry governing bodies. This benefits clients for audit purposes.
E-learning engagement rates of over 90% which is industry leading, compared to 40% e-learning standards. This is achieved through animation and storytelling.
Online sales SaaS platform that no other security education company in the UK currently provides, allowing monthly payment options instead of larger up front pricing. 
Quantifiable risk reduction data, example being ‘Think Before You Click’ Phishing simulation to HMRC which has been running for 5 years reducing risk by 75%.
We have global clients, such as Burberry and have the ability for global scalability with course translations in 14 languages. Multiple languages is a huge benefit for these clients.",Services,"We combine both psychological and cognitive behavioural analysis to target & measure awareness training that effectively changes behaviours and in beds security culture. Behavioural analysis has been carried out over 12 years to develop a psychological understanding of what causes risky online cyber behaviour. The results have the capacity to predict the behaviour of employees going forward, allowing for a long term view of expected future risk to the organisation and its training needs.","Our future solution is to create an industry leading Ai-Powered Cyber Security Learning suite named “CyberLearn.Ai”, which will encompass all of our current services as well as new services using cutting-edge technologies. The suite will provide both our current clients and prospective clients with all the information and data analytics that they need in one completely automated, user-friendly SaaS platform. We can then, through the use of machine learning, automatically decipher the strengths and weaknesses of every individual within an organisation, and provide each employee with a unique and highly targeted training plan designed around not only their level of knowledge for each topic but also around their individual demographic profile, their psychological profile and their preferred learning style.","Bobs Business simplifies cyber security, maximising engagement by creating emotional responses through storytelling, animation and gamification to break poor habits.

Our business has seen organic growth in an upward curve without the use of marketing skills in house. We were due pre COVID-19 to hit a £1.2M revenue(now £850K), but to scale we recognise the need for a CMO to target our markets that sit in professional services settings.

The shareholders intend to sell a minority stake in the company in return for the investment to finance the market entry and the subsequent growth phase.
SALT is a company that has developed a data-based and automated production of individual furniture and carpentry products. The B2B business model of a Smart Factory provides outsourced production capacity for carpenters, architects and other professional suppliers of custom-made furniture, enabling them to achieve additional sales growth through ""mass customization"" maintaining the same capacities. SALT solves the problems of the traditional craftsmen sector (high capacity utilization, lack of skilled workers and succession in the classic carpentry business), enables the purchase of individual shapes, designs and formats  for the first time ever and also offers clear cost advantages in the manufacturing of individual products through fully automated industrial production. This way, SALT enables the traditional craftsmen's business making the leap into Industry 4.0, creates a unique range of products and has the potential to revolutionize the furniture market. 


The carpenter is provided with a planning and design tool and can efficiently address all price segments in the market by expanding competencies and production capacities. A key feature is the holistic conception of consistent designs across different usage and price segments. While in the furniture industry, for example, bathroom, kitchen and living room furniture is almost exclusively offered by different manufacturers, with SALT's support the carpenter can create consistently designed ""living concepts"", adapt them to individual needs and produce them in SALT's Smart Factory. Overall, the concept combines the advantages of efficient industrial production in large quantities with the customizability and quality of traditional craftsmanship.


The market can be widely served, as the business model opens up new potentials for the carpentry craftsmanship and offers solutions for existing challenges. SALT is not a substitute for craftsmen, but acts as a service provider for the carpenter. The carpenter trade market alone, with a volume of 25 billion € (DACH region), offers a high market potential for SALT solutions. Beyond this defined core market, SALT's offering is attractive to other users such as large furniture manufacturers, (real estate) project developers, architects and large bathroom and kitchen retailers. This market has a volume of approximately €40 billion and is defined as the market and competitive environment in the long term. The ultimate goal is to use SALT to enable the necessary new positioning of the craftsmanship in the furniture market and to strengthen it on the design and competence level as well as on the cost side. The result is a new formation of the market structure - away from the dominance of the furniture industry and towards a strong positioning of a more efficient carpentry business.",Combined; Services; Software,Professional presentation documents and infinite design possibilities,Possibility for carpenters to outsource construction and production,"No capacity bottlenecks and

SDVs offer a multitude of advantages such as reduction in operational cost, enhanced workforce safety, and decrement in production time.

Increased flexibility in comparison to traditional material handling equipment. 

Whatever application being accomplished today can be easily modified tomorrow. 

Scalability can often be accomplished in a few hours, and it’s a fairly simple task to relocate AMR systems to different zones, buildings, or states within a day or two.

Increased accuracy: Because AMRs and robots can automatically scan/verify, the end result is often a much higher order accuracy rate

Higher throughputs: AMRs rely on both a robotic control system (RCS) and either your WES or WMS, they can automatically generate the shortest routes to each destination. 

Lower risk of single point of failure: Because AMRs typically work in fleets, there is a layer of redundancy that is not typically available with other solutions like conveyors, sorters, and AS/RS system.

(1) Laser scan the interior of the industrial facility to obtain its 3D precise model including architecture, utilities, production and robotic equipments; 
(2) Connect the 3D plant model to the facility to obtain a 3D real-time animation of the production process for accurate assessment of manufacturing capacity and to understand the root cause of production problems;
(3) Run 3D production and ergonomics optimization scenarios to find the best way to solve manufacturing problems, reduce recalls and downtime, and improve operational efficiency. The virtual scenarios can be validated through virtual reality training where workers go immersively inside the new manufacturing scenarios and execute the new optimized production tasks for efficient implementation of improved production processes.
The 3D gamification technology for production management allows industry to keep plants operating at high efficiency and resilience while they are monitored remotely and/or in teleworking.

Since February 2020 they have seen monthly revenues increase from £30k to £200k. They are currently raising £2m Series A investment.
Night Zookeeper is an education technology company building a globally loved children’s brand, based on its fully-owned IP. It has a core SAAS product that improves children’s literacy skills through interactive learning games. The platform empowers children’s imaginations similarly to Roblox ($4bn valuation) or Minecraft  ($2.5bn sale). 

Children create characters that come to-life on the website and can then feature in personalised books, learning games and even an animated TV series. The TV show (already on SKY in the UK) assists in the company’s go-to-market strategy by reducing its cost of customer acquisition.  
This is a business that can go after two $100bn a year industries, is growing fast, and has a CAC of £35 vs a potential LTV of more than £140+. 

70% of under 12s globally are classified as low achievers in writing, having only reached a basic level of written English. Night Zookeeper’s solution helps. The product has a 75% conversion rate on 7-day free trials and inspires users to log on 3.5 x a week for 25 minute sessions.

To-date it has inspired the creation of over 1 million magical animals and it’s animation has been seen on Sky TV in the U.K. and in 90% of elementary schools in the US. 


The company owns 65% of a £530k animated series that can be sold globally. A deal has just been done in China and they are in talks with broadcasters in Australia, Germany, Iceland and more. It has incredible advisors in place including the former MD of Nickelodeon, and a passionate and relentless management team. 

The business sells parent, teacher and school subscriptions in monthly, quarterly or annual packages to it’s SAAS platform. Additionally it’s B2B function sells licenses to it’s animated series, books and character artwork to licensing partners globally. Finally it sells merchandise directly to its subscribers, increasing their lifetime value to the company. 

Quarterly growth of parent revenue is the focus of management.

Night Zookeeper was created through the shared mission of a passionate management team, keen to make the world a better place for children.

Creativity

Joshua Davidson, the creator of the story books and digital concept behind the platform, noticed during his MA in Digital Practices, that digital games for children neglected their natural desire to create! Kids love to be creative and express themselves but most games simply let kids play with preset designs, with little room for their own imaginations. He wanted to create something that would redress this balance. 

The massive success of Minecraft (£2.5bn exit) and Roblox (£4bn valuation) to digitise creative play patterns like the ones children enjoy with LEGO, supported his assertion that a digital platform, which adds value to other traditional creative play activities such as drawing and writing, is needed and highly desirable by both children and their parents and teachers. 

Literacy

Paul Hutson, co-founder and former primary school teacher realised that Josh’s vision complimented perfectly his desire to bring more project-based learning experiences to children. Having worked in schools globally as a head of literacy, Paul had seen first hand the power of the Night Zookeeper story and co-creation activities on students, and wanted to create a scalable way for children around the world to experience them. As a literacy teacher at the highest fee-paying school in Abu Dhabi, he knew the importance of student motivation in studying reading and writing and the challenges faced by many children in these subjects. He believed that Night Zookeeper had a unique opportunity to have a genuine impact, at scale, on children’s education. 

Children’s Brand

Graphic designer and illustrator Simon Burman, is another co-founder in the business. As well as being fully united in the company mission to improve literacy through creative play at scale, Simon, or Buzz as he is known, has a passion for branding. He wants to bring the very highest-quality design and branding expertise to edtech and Josh’s story world to motivate children. Coming from a background in design at the highest level - packaging for Coca Cola and Levi’s, he wants to use his visual powers for good to captivate and inspire children to learn.","Storytelling

In logistics they fit in vehicle architectures perfectly (e.g. logistics scooters, fork lifters or automated guided vehicles) and come with smart software solutions, that allow to have an automated charging process, predictive battery maintenance and fleet management. In taxi waiting lines they make charging possible while moving up and enable electric taxis.

There are time losses due to plug-in and -out operations and it lowers the battery life, because people do not keep the ideal 20-80% battery level. SIS offers inductive charging solutions (wireless) with a perfect positioning in accurate order and adds smart software services for digital fleet management and optimized charging behaviour. 
Taxis have the perfect driving profile for electric mobility. Unfortunately, in taxis business the vehicles are waiting in lines and moving forward to the pick-up position when there is a customer. Charging electric taxis by cable is no option (because plug-in/out for every step forward). With a project consortium SIS develops a wireless charging solution for charging point operators combined with a service application for taxi drivers, where to find the next wireless charging spots, which takes also care of the easy to handle billing process.","Logistics vehicles become more comfortable when operated with the SIS charging systems and added services because of cable-free charging processes. This includes accurate alignment in charging position, automated start and monitoring of charging and leads to less cable problems (e.g. cable chaos), lower vehicle wear (battery and vehicle body) and higher fleet utilization. 
Taxi waiting lines become eco-friendly with the SIS charging systems and get enabled for electric taxis. Taxi drivers can charge while moving forward, get information about the next charging spot available on their phone application.",Combined,"SIS offers charging solutions that come with smart services, which collect valuable data and make charging and operating the logistics and taxi vehicles way more gentle, comfortable and intelligent.","SIS offers system-solutions, that are tightly integrated into existing vehicle architectures and the periphery they are operated.

Creol’s system allows users to control the building, whilst getting live verified data that they can understand that allows them to reduce their energy consumption. Their own footprint will be ranked against the other building users and other Creol users. This not only gives than an idea how well they perform locally but gamifies their impact globally. 
Because no building can ever have no environmental impact, should users choose to, Creol’s system can automatically offset the remaining impact with Carbon Credits and Renewable Energy Certificates via tokenised trackable and verifiable credits. 
All the data in the Creol system is transacted on Blockchain, this is beneficial for users so they know they can trust any information from the Creol system, but also means they can publish their data live and prove the impact that their changes are making.

PaxMile gives the possibility to e-commerce players and finally to their customers to have access to premium delivery services without incurring in additional fees. Spinoff of the Polytechnic of Milan, PaxMile establishes a new business model within a traditional industry by redesigning everything bottom-up with a new two-echelon distribution model which makes the use of GIG workers more sustainable and efficient (by being able to employ gig workers outside of peaks and potentially throughout the day).

PaxMile squeezes operating costs and at the same time brings a new premium delivery experience to e-commerce shoppers (not altering the curve of costs). The team has developed a proprietary technology based on the most advanced stages of operational research and machine learning. Premium delivery services will become the norm thanks to PaxMile.

There are three main actors involved:
A) Nowadays customers are spoiled by better delivery service in the food delivery industry, premium is no longer an option but an imperative. 80% of people want home delivery and flexibility. Returns are critical. We have rebuilt from scratch the distribution model and thanks to our technology we are able to meet massively the evolution of customers’ demand.

B) At the same time delivery options and experience strongly influence clients’ purchasing habits. Retailers aren’t meeting customer increasing expectations for e-commerce delivery. E-commerce players want to keep delivery costs stable and offer greener solutions.

C) From a logistics standpoint the current standard model is broken, moving from B2B to B2C means an higher number of stops, less parcels per stop, low van saturation, higher costs, congestion, pollution, missed deliveries and a structural rigidity which makes the offer of premium delivery options a luxury.","Retailers and e-commerce players:
• Offer premium delivery and return service at no premium costs
• Gain market share and retain customers
• Improved social sustainability

E-shoppers (our indirect clients):
• Choose the delivery window till late evening
• Choose the return delivery window till late evening
• Reschedule delivery time and address within certain cut off times
• All this at no extra cost
• Uber-like tracking
• 60% reduction of CO2 emission per parcel delivered",Services Software,PaxMile introduces a new distribution model that makes it the only one that can offer premium delivery services at no extra costs.

How often do you find difficult to get an early customer feedback?
How often do you struggle with cashflow when committing to the property project?

Or simpler as it would be on the sales demo for new property development:
Let's say that you have a development of a block of 10 flats.
Each of those would cost £150,000 to build and you gets your business £300,00 or each sale.
That's 10 times £150k cost to build and a return of 10 times £300k on the whole development.
It also means that you need to secure the financing & once secured - pay interest on top of it of 5% percent.
Now taking it from there - imagine that you sell 2 of those flats before you take financing. 
It means that your financing needs have been reduced by 2 times £150k = £300k but really you got money of 2 times £300k = £600k which perhaps can cover the construction costs of 4 flats & saving go even further on interest.

This way:
You need less finance - easier & faster to get.
It means less interest from the credit you still might need to take.
It means that the customers have already shown interest & there is a domino effect that speeds up the sales cycle of the next ones because people will be talking to their friends & families.
You have the presence with your development in the social media, website, fairs even before it is constructed. This generates extra traction over time and you always have something to show not only on your website but also social media and on the big screen at any trade shows.
When you get your cashflow right - you can get the next development faster.

2. Universe - through very advanced use of data science we cover the full market of approx. 26.000 fund managers; we deep-research each manager and - via very much data - are able to rank on overall quality. This no one else can do, no one.Our investments that way become much more diversified, can be more granular and can be executed very fast as we know exactly where to invest. This compares to a large institution who has investment relations with typically less than 100 managers because they cannot get data on more/remain focused - this leads to us being much stronger form a process and transparency point of view, and we should add better managers to most portfolios by having this overview
3. Investment speed. We have a data science generated short-list from which experienced human investment managers will try to remove entrants. Compares to institutions that scramble to build and maintain a pipeline from known relations. We know all managers in the market for funds (or that will come shortly) and can underwrite before a manager hits the market raising funds. The institutions compete. The difference is that we invest within one year whereas an average manager may spend 4 years. The NPV difference can be as high as 30% with equal fund-level IRR.
4. Advisory service layers. We are an attractive partner for both GPs and LPs. We offer GPs underwriting AND portfolio digitalization strategies as well as use od data science in the GPs own ops - We offer LPs in-depth analysis of existing portfolios and co-investment investor qualities, data science strategy assistance etc - all services that neither GP nor LP can get from other managers
5. We offer evergreen/permanant capital structures. Not unique to us, but a structure that comes easy because we start without a legacy of carried interest. It means optimization of portfolio structures via the ability to wrap the best investments ""in-house"" instead of watching a GP sell off to make money for themselves - and a better overall liquidity profile for LPs, hopefully avoiding ""GP-led restructurings""

The long process of “keeping sit” the human body in a wheelchair is quite unusual to its normal functions and inevitably leads to life-long secondary health problems, such as: deep vein thrombosis, urinary tract infections, muscular spasms, osteoporosis, decubital wounds and many others. The healing process takes a lot of time, suffering and money. Wheelchair users need expensive adaptation of the surrounding interior in their homes and work premises, including a lot of free space to maneuver. They use special vehicles (vans) to transport their aids. Often they are not capable to perform their everyday activities without assistance.

We are extremely concerned that the technological advances that have led to the advent of the gig economy have left millions of workers who were already vulnerable in an even more precarious position. Workers have suffered with constantly changing and erratic work hours, little protection from being at the whim of zero-hour contracts, a lack of job security, a lack of flexibility in their schedules and are faced with rising prices and stagnant wages. Especially in the foodservice and hospitality sector, the industry where Tuki is currently focused, these challenges faced by workers directly impact businesses creating two of their biggest operational problems: it increases daily volatility in staffing and leads to a high annual staff turnover (70%+). Tuki is obsessed with the challenges faced by industry and we believe the key to solving this problem is by developing a solution that works effectively for all stakeholders.","By using our interconnected system, businesses can maximise daily operations and maintain full teams while sharing costs within their trust network, which for workers means increased flexibility, reduced stress, the benefits of full-time employment and finally, opportunities to earn extra cash without the need to find multiple jobs.",Services; Software,Holistic system designed to solve the problem not just address the symptoms.,Impact focussed that meets new EU regulations on gig economy.,Market networks SaaS company.,Big Data; Machine Learning,Food & Beverage; Retail; Accommodation & Food Service (HoReCa),Cost Efficiencies; Disruption,4. 4.

Our Infrastructure Software helps industrial organizations run secure and reliable applications on-premise, or as the industry calls this, at the edge of the network, right next to the data source.

The platform enables agility and rapid delivery of new features and applications at the edge, allowing industrial organizations to modernize their IT infrastructure and overcome industry challenges associated to their infrastructure and processes being out of date. And this with ZERO DOWNTIME.

The viciniti platform helps manage the hardware, operating system, and all the applications used on premise - allowing industrial organizations to run any application on any hardware, and easily scale on demand.

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to deploy and run applications at the edge.",50000.0,250000.0,"St.  James House, 13 Kensington Square",31/12/2013,"",Armine Saidi,We do not have one at the moment,David Esteves,"",Armin Saidi,armin@viciniti.co,'+374 98 344 361 or + 44 7456 242 719,Via Startup Lisboa introduction,Ilya Velder,iv@basinghall.partners,B2B,"We help industrial organizations with their digital transformation needs, helping then create smarter enterprise environments allowing them, more so enabling them, to easily deploy on-premise edge computing capabilities.  

We live in a smart world and it's getting smarter every day.  The Internet of things has entered the world of manufacturing bringing with it countless new data points and opening the door to greater operational and economic efficiency.

Our customers are pursuing real-time data processing, monitoring and local system control to greatly improve efficiency. 

However, it’s a lot harder today to deploy computing and applications on-premise than it is on cloud services where the security, servers, networking, services, etc is readily available. To deploy at the edge requires the skills, time, and work arounds involving building mini datacentres with associated functionalities.

This is where viciniti comes in.

Allowing them to run any containerized and orchestrated (kubernetes) application on any hardware (predictive maintenance, SCADA, AI, ML, to name a few).

In summary, we make it easy to build, deploy and manage local edge clouds, thus:

- Better management of assets and operations.
- Providing improved security, reliability, scalability and enhanced processing speed  all done on-premise.",Software; Combined,"'- Hardware agnostic scalable architecture: Using containerization technologies, the viciniti platform is hardware-agnostic making it possible to run and manage any application across a varied set of hardware without modifications.","'- Container based deployments: Developers can securely deploy and manage their own containerized applications at the edge with a single touch, thus leverage any language and framework. It’s as easy as building for the Cloud.","'- Scalability: Scale on demand.  The platform is configured for easy plug-and-play deployment.  Need more computing power? Plug more devices to the network and watch them scale on-demand. Scale to any number of locations, applications and devices.

2.	As a result, we were granted a strong Patent for proximity based networks. Which gives us defensible differentiation against our competitors.

- Art market is deemed ""opaque"": our vision is that people should know what they are paying for. We are 100% transparent on our platform and display the different components of the finale price for each painting in sale. We are transparent.

- We handle payment and transaction: We offer a ""safety net"" to our users first, through the possibility to try Original Paintings directly on their wall and so get a clear idea of the item they'd like to purchase, but also through our refund policies (100% for an Original Painting, 90% for a Custom Painting). In addition, we ensure a safe transaction between users and artists and manage the shipment (each painting is insured). We are trustworthy.

- We innovate the market: We embrace the trend of the ""customized product"" with Custom Paintings, modernizing the Art industry and expanding the market to new potential users looking for high-quality custom/bespoke product. We offer custom Art. This allows us not only to attack the existing online Art market but to expand it to new users.

I a nutshell: Almost all problems we all have with the internet and apps on a daily bases have the same reason: providers. Users search for content and want to enjoy this content as fast as possible. Platforms which offers the most content (like Facebook with your friends, Netflix with films, Amazon with shopping) also have the most value for users, because content = value. So users want content, but search engines or app stores only find providers, e.g. homepages or apps; the content is ""behind"" this providers and users are often forced to register (just to find out, which content the provider is offering) or download hundreds of different apps; often this apps don't work on the devices the user want to use (e.g. iOS, PS4, web, etc.) and very often it's very confusing to find the content in a new app with a new, different interface (especially older people hate this and that's why they often don't use apps at all; connect looks like a virtual home and is therefore most intuitive to use + users only need to understand ONE interface, instead of one per provider/app); instead of forcing users to download hundreds of apps or register everywhere, they will only have e.g. on contact list in connect or one video player, where they can find all contacts from all other networks or all video media worldwide (provider-independent, e.g. everything from netflix, amazon prime, youtube, social network video sharings, twitch, TV-channels, video calls, local storage videos, etc.); users will save a lot of time and they can search for content provider-independent, before they decide, if they really want to register (e.g. for Netflix) and get a subscription (we can take a fee for selling subscriptions too). We will integrate all bigger content providers using their API or web-scrapping, but we also offer our own API (simple web platform to link all content, e.g. streaming-links to TV-channels), so that smaller providers can integrate themselves. We will also develop an AI that scraps the internet automatically and gets all content integrated.","",Services; Software,"Topic independent Content Aggregator (all content like media, communications, shopping, services, games, etc. in only one app)","New (content) interface for (1) all devices (incl.

CEO: ~ 100-120 hours / week (management experiences before)
CFO: ~ 5-10 hours / week (own real estate company with 14 millions turnover, very profitable, very fast growing)
CTO: ~ 50-70 hours / week (had own companies before, developed many own games)

Strength: We are all extremely talented in our fields. Please have a closer look into our pitch-deck (or online pitch-deck: https://www.4invest-e.com/pitch-deck) and the links you can find there. Very short:

Michael (CEO): extremely good in problem solving, understands what users want in detail, very critical and forward-thinking
Robert (CFO): extremely critical, hard business man, talented with financials and money, younger brother of Michael, who builds about 100-200 flats per year and his company grows very fast and is very profitable
Peter (CTO): made more than 5 user-ready games with 0,5 millions of users, everything made by himself (sounds, graphics, programming), leader of VR/AR team of a big company for 8 years, 25 years experience as developer, focus on our technology (Unity) and VR/AR as well as games / gamification","We will later need a great CSO, currently our management team is extremely low, to save costs (we invest everything into product development, no money for marketing or sales - which is not necessary now, but will become necessary in the next 6 months, when we released connect. Currently we have a lack of ""self-presenting"", Michael as a terrible speaker / presenter and has less time to improve; our social media appearance would also need polishing, it's less a problem of skill and more of time (and focus on even more important stuff). But our project could be much more impressive if we had more ressources for public relations, sales and marketing. Robert, the CFO also has less time for our project, but that has never been a problem, since financial topics currently don't need much effort and time.","Product development, but with much psychological understanding and user focus (so our focus is not too technical, but also more on business models, usability and creating a great user experience and value).","Beside an investment with connecting us with the right first B2B partners (VR shopping, product placement, media, (FinTech) services, etc. and with a great sales and marketing team. We already have hundreds of connections to big companies that would love to work with us and just wait for us being ready with the product (next months), however, every new client could bring as a lot of money, e.g. if we would offer product placement for one year (or for a specific amount of views/interactions) for a fix price like e.g. 10k - 50k euros. Once we can show user traction (currently 40k downloads - testers -, but not yet market ready) and the great advantages of VR advertising, it will make sense to focus on sales.

Additionally we will grow fast with adding a ""sent by connect""-link to all Mulit-Messenger messages our users send to all their friends into different networks (FB, SMS, mail...) and with media reports (media have to report about us to get the integration for free - we have 200,000 contacts worldwide); we have some more growth-hacks, so acquisition of USERS will be cheap (and of partners also, once we have about 30-50k users)",29 (short term) - 199 (long term) € per USER (not B2B-partner / ads client),1.0,500000000000.0,Rec Room,Oculus (Facebook),VR Chat,"Getting funding - not what you want to hear, but in my opinion the only real challenge we need to master, because we have great solutions for all other challenges.","Technically: integrate as much big content providers as possible, even if they don't have an API and don't want to get integrated (via web-scrapping, reverse engineering, etc. - we have solutions for this all, however, it's a different situation for every content provider and could become a challenge in some cases). The more content we can offer within connect, the higher the value for our users; the more users we have, the more we will earn with B2B-partners an in-app-purchases.","As soon as web 3.0 becomes suitable for the mass market and connect proves to be successful, there will certainly be many imitators. We currently have very little competition, but in the medium term we can expect that all major companies will also try to use the new chances of VR or web 3.0, comparable to the development of the Internet. That's why it will be a challenge for us to become a market leader as fast as possible, which will then make us the most attractive provider in the long term from the user's point of view, because we will then simply offer the most content.",100000.0,240000.0,Year 2,6-10,230000000.0,127000000.0,20.0,2.0,01/01/2016,Friends & Family; Angels; Founders,1.0,100.0,0.0,1200000.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3000000.0,Product Development,Working Capital,Personnel,Yes,"","","","","",,,"",251 days,"","",,"",""

This solution is very simple. How?
1. Our booking flow is a direct booking flow: Travely links the customer ( traveler ) directly to the Hotel PMS, so no more middleman and no more commission.
2. We will use a new business model, based on a fixed monthly subscription fee to be paid by each Hotel. ( the same business model is used by companies like Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime and many other companies )
3. We will split the 15% commission between the traveler and the Hotel which means a cheaper price for the traveler ( 10% reduction ) ) and a saving of 5% for the hotel.
Travely is also different from its competitors by it's user friendly app which gives  a competitive advantage:
1. We are the first on the market with a Global Direct Booking App
2. We can always give the best price to travelers as there is no middle man

Further to follow,"",Real Estate; Manufacture,CEF; Duisport,"",24/10/2019,Ilya Velder,Poland,11/11/2019,"","Bin-e is an IoT smart waste bin designed to tackle shortcomings of manual waste sorting in indoor spaces. Why? Because waste separation at source is a central part of any given waste manage-ment system worldwide.
It constitutes a first step in the waste management process and plays a key role in its overall per-formance.
The disruptiveness of Bin-e 5.0 lays in its ability to automatically recognize multi-object input thrown into the container and sort it into recyclable fractions at a >90% accuracy. This improves the composition of waste streams collected at a site and their suitability for downstream pre-treatment, sorting and recovery operations (waste can also be automatically classified as second-ary raw materials (SRMs)).",200000.0,400000.0,"Innowatorów 8, Dabrowa",01/01/2016,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rt4t2fNNB9BVKS_ERC7TzdJTBnqvrb8t,Jakub Luboński,Aleksandra Lubońska,Marcin Łotysz,Jacek Kędzia,Jakub Luboński,kuba@bine.world,'+48661111105,Contact from event in Dresden,Yannick Wilden,yw@basinghallpartners.com,B2B,"1.	Unfavourable mindset towards recycling: For years, people were throwing waste to one bin. Old habits are hard to break because this requires additional attention and effort.
2.	Confusing recycling guidelines and lack of knowledge: The recycling rules tend to be complex and to vary between countries, even within the EU. While staff members might be open to the idea of disposing of their waste in a more environmentally responsible way, they might not have the knowledge or know what to do. One of the most widespread problems, of-ten leading to confusion when selecting the correct container, is the disposal of multi-material packaging.
3.	Inefficiency of waste separation process: the current mainstream process is to sort waste into particular recyclable fractions at waste processing facilities, after it is initially sepa-rated by and collected from FMs. Today, this initial waste separation is done manually by FMs cleaning service, a process which is both time and resource consuming. As indicated by our test partner (a global facility services company ISS A/S), as much as 70% of cleaning service time spent on waste segregation can be saved with Bin-e.
4.	Unoptimized waste collection process: Waste collection is scheduled at fixed time slots. Therefore, some bins are collected half-empty, while other are already overloaded at the col-lection time.
5.	High cost of waste removal: non-optimized waste management process generates costs on the FMs side (labour costs + time) as well as on the waste collectors’ side (fuel, component wear, labour cost), not to mention the excess carbon footprint.","1. Unmatched accuracy in waste type recognition and separation
Currently, Bin-e is already capable of identifying 32 different waste categories (including organic waste) at a market-leading 80-85% accuracy (compared to 30-40% accuracy of manual sorting by using traditional waste bins). Bin-e 4.0 will offer 91% accuracy, while Bin-e 5.0 will add a multi-object recognition functionality on the top of it. For FMs, this means less time spent by the cleaning service on manual waste segregation after emptying the bins, leading to signifi-cant time and cost savings in this regard (up 70%). Additionally, from the WMC standpoint, waste processed by Bin-e and collected from FMs will be qualified as Secondary Raw Materials (SRM) without further processing at the waste management plant, leading to further savings in the waste management chain.
2.	Wide customization possibilities
Bin-e is the most universal smart bin on the market. Depending on the national, regional or local legal waste segregation requirements, Bin-e can be set up differently. It is possible to cus-tomize our product both from a hardware and software standpoint (including code re-programming) to make Bin-e suitable for different waste types. For instance, in Poland MSW is supposed to be sorted to the following fractions: glass, paper, organic, and plastic and metal (to-gether), whereas in Sweden these fractions are: papier, plastic, plastic bottles, mixed.
3.	Full automation
Bin-e requires minimum involvement from the user. The consumer’s activity is only limited to disposing the waste into the waste chamber, which is easy, effortless, and convenient (especially when multiple items can be submitted at once) allowing for maximum compliance with waste management rules.
4.	Waste compression and fill-level monitoring
Automatic compression mechanism increases the capacity of the chambers. More waste can be stored in a smaller space, and the frequency of waste collection can be reduced even eightfold. Fill-level sensors inform the facility managers about the current level of waste in the containers to optimize the collection time and collection routes.
5.	Wide applicability
Bin-e is was initially designed for large office buildings and commercial premises. However, it can also be applied in all kinds of indoor spaces, such as smart buildings, shopping malls, public insti-tutions, airports, train stations, etc., ensuring high scalability of our innovation.
6.	Data collection and analysis
With Bin-e data on the type of waste or product can be collected. On one hand, this enables the analysis of consumers’ purchasing habits, which potentially can lead to increasing the environmen-tal awareness of Bin-e users and changing their waste-related behaviour patterns. On the other hand, this data can be used for customer research purposes, product modifications (e.g. packag-ing homogenization), and profit creation. For us, the main benefit of data collection is the possibil-ity of using it as the training data in the machine learning loop to improve Bin-e performance in particular working environment.

The company is currently testing a variation of our fertilizer coating technology, which we created upon their request.

However, it is important to mention that thus far, none of these competitors have developed a pH-regulating fertilizer coating. Their coated fertilizer simply control nutrient release without regulating environmental factors. We do not expect them to develop such technologies in the near future.

Another important point is that our competitors are also our potential customers, as they use our licensed tech in order to upgrade their existing fertilizers.","The second challenge we're currently facing is lack of funds to accelerate our R&D and bring our existing techs to market.
