# A case of Compliance Testing - Fairness Assessment using R
 K-means training exercise in R based on Basing Hall-BIC table from 25-May-2021

## Purpose
<p>In this exercise you will learn how to determine clusters of similar companies from the Basing Hall-BIC Register of Interest database on the basis of the semantic tags identified by the LSEG Intelligent Tagging (Open Calais) service from the juxtaposition of 3 descriptive fields present in the database.<br> These fields are respectively:<br> 
<ul>
  <li>2.2 Value Proposition</li>
  <li>2.3 Customer's pain points</li>
  <li>2.4 TOP benefits for customer</li>
</ul><br>

## Method
 This exercise will follow the content of the dev-journal file: R_Procedures_Fairness analysis_25-May-2021.txt

 > <p><strong>Step1</strong> - Load data and libraries -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step1)</p>
 > <p><strong>Step2</strong> - Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and evaluate clustering potential in various factor scores subspaces -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step2)</p>
 > <p><strong>Step3</strong> - Perform K-means on a factor scores sub-space at evaluate performance with a minimum number of clusters -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step3)</p>
 > <p><strong>Step4</strong> - Display retained clusters statistics -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step4)</p>
 > <p><strong>Step5</strong> - Evaluate fairness of Basing Hall-BIC selection process -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step5)</p>
