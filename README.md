 K-means training exercise in R based on Basing Hall-BIC table from 25-May-2021

## Method
 This exercise will follow the content of the dev-journal file: R_Procedures_Fairness analysis_25-May-2021.txt

 > Step1 - Load data and libraries [Open step 1 folder](https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step1)
 > Step2 - Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and evaluate clustering potential in various factor scores subspaces
 > Step3 - Perform K-means on a factor scores sub-space at evaluate performance with a minimum number of clusters
 > Step4 - Display retained clusters statistics
 > Step5 - Evaluate fairness of Basing Hall-BIC selection process
