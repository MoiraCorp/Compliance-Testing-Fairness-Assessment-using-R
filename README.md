 > <p><strong>Step1</strong> - Load data and libraries -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step1)</p>
 > <p><strong>Step2</strong> - Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and evaluate clustering potential in various factor scores subspaces -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step2)</p>
 > <p><strong>Step3</strong> - Perform K-means on a factor scores sub-space at evaluate performance with a minimum number of clusters -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step3)</p>
 > <p><strong>Step4</strong> - Display retained clusters statistics -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step4)</p>
 > <p><strong>Step5</strong> - Evaluate fairness of Basing Hall-BIC selection process -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/Innovkg-exercise-km/tree/main/step5)</p>
