### Saving the group (class) vector table for future use
In the present example, the data tables is located in directory: C:\Projets_En_Cours\AI_MTPL__BasingHall\25-May-2021\Results

> <em>write.csv(grp,"C:/Projets_En_Cours/AI_MTPL/__BasingHall/25-May-2021/Results/grp.csv", sep=",")</em><br>

NOTE -> The group vector grp is exported and then modified for transfer of a few odd companies into of a group 6 for outliers
